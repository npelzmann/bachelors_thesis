# bachelors_thesis

This is the code to my bachelor's thesis. The notebook 'data_preprocessing.ipynb' contains the preprocessing of the raw time series data of the sum of the thrust force sensors. The notebook 'Neural_Network.ipynb' contains the normalization of the data and the training and evaluation of the neural networks for the two feature sets.
